D. Installation
	
	D.1 Driver install
		Please create a directory under root directory,  e.g /temp, do commands:

		# cd /
		# mkdir temp

		After get driver file "wch_vx.x.x.x.tar.gz". Copy file to /temp
		directory, then extract and install, do commands:

		# cp wch_vx.x.x.x.tar.gz /temp 
		# cd /temp
		# tar xvfz wch_vx.x.x.x.tar.gz
		# cd /temp/wch
		# make clean ; make install

		*************************************************************
		* If system is Suse 9.0 and errors occur when               *
		* "make clean ; make install", do commands:                 *
		*                                                           *
		* # cd /usr/src/linux/                                      *
		* # make cloneconfig                                        *
		* # make dep                                                * 
		*                                                           *
		* then do "make clean ; make install" again in /temp/wch	*
		*************************************************************

		Load driver module, do command:

		# modprobe wch
		or
		# insmod /temp/wch/driver/wch.ko (wch.o for kernel 2.4)


		Check driver module, do command:
		# lsmod | grep wch


		Unload driver, do command:
		# rmmod wch


	D.2 Device node creation 
		Each serial port has one device node which is named "ttyWCH?",
		maximum up to 256 serial ports.
		
		This setp will be done when do "make clean ; make install", if
		device nodes aren't in /dev, do commands:
				
		# cd /temp/wch/wchmknod
		# ./wchmknod

		This will create device nodes in /dev.

E. Loading driver automatic after system bootup

  	
	E.1 
	    After finish item D. Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local for loading driver 
	    automatic after system bootup. Use vi or other editor to open rc.local, 
	    and add "modprobe wch" in last line.


	E.2 
	    After finish item D.
	    Edit /etc/rc.d/boot.local for loading driver automatic after system bootup. 
	    Use vi or other	editor to open boot.local, and add "modprobe wch" in last line.
	    Edit /etc/rc.d/halt.lAfter finish item D. Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local for loading driver 
	    automatic after system bootup. Use vi or other editor to open rc.local, 
	    and add "modprobe wch" in last line.ocal for unloading driver when system halt. 
	    Use vi or other editor to open halt.local, and add "rmmod wch" in last line.
	    
	    
	E.3 
	    After finish item D. Edit /etc/init.d/rc.local for loading driver 
	    automatic after system bootup. Use vi or other editor to open rc.local, 
	    and add words as below in last line.
				
			modprobe wch
		
	E.4 
	    After finish item D. Edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local for loading driver 
	    automatic after system bootup. Use vi or other editor to open rc.local, 
	    and add words as below in last lien. 
		
			modprobe wch
		
		
	E.5 
	    In general, other distributions will loading driver automatic after system bootup.		
	    If it doesn't, please refer to item E.1 or E.2. or E.3 or E.4

F. Utility

	F1. wchdump - dump port informations, do command:

		# wchdump

		the informations should be like this

		================ Found  8 WCH port , list informations ====================
        		                                     WCH driver ver -- 2.0.0.0

		ttyWCH0 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9000,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH1 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9400,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH2 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9800,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH3 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9c00,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH4 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9008,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH5 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9408,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH6 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9808,    irq = 169

		ttyWCH7 --
		WCH CH358_8S Series (bus:1 device: 9) , base address = 9c08,    irq = 169
		=============================================================================

		In this case, 

		Driver version is 2.0.0.0

		ttyWCH0 is the 1st serial port on wch CH358_8S series board, 
		base address is 0x9000 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH1 is the 2nd serial port on wch CH358_8S series board, 
		base address is 0x9400 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH2 is the 3rd serial port on wch CH358_8S series board,
		base address is 0x9800 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH3 is the 4th serial port on wch CH358_8S series board,
		base address is 0x9C00 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH4 is the 5th serial port on wch CH358_8S series board,
		base address is 0x9008 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH5 is the 6th serial port on wch CH358_8S series board,
		base address is 0x9408 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH6 is the 7th serial port on wch CH358_8S series board,
		base address is 0x9808 and irq is 169.

		ttyWCH7 is the 8th serial port on wch CH358_8S series board,
		base address is 0x9C08 and irq is 169.

		bus:1 means the bus number of board is 1.
		device:9 means the device number of board is 9.

		If no information print on screen. Make sure the device node
		exist in /dev and driver module loaded.

		
		
	F2. wchterm - dumb terminal for test tty device node data transmitting and receiving, do command:

		# wchterm
